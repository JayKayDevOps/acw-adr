Context
In a contact center environment, agents need time after receiving a contact to complete necessary task. Currently, agents must manually switch to a "Not Ready" state to do after-call work. This can lead to inefficiency and skewed stats in the reporting logs.
To address this, we propose adding a Timed After Call Work (ACW) feature to the Contact Center Agent UI, which will automatically grant agents a predefined period after each call to complete their work before being available for the next interaction. Once implemented we will then make it by a service level. Support service may  need more time that Sales service. 

Decision
We will implement a Timed ACW feature in the Contact Center Agent UI with the following characteristics:
    • Automatic ACW Activation: After ending a call, the agent is placed in ACW mode automatically.
    • Configurable Timer: ACW time can be set at the system level by administrators and optionally adjusted per queue or agent profile.
    • UI Timer Display: A visible countdown timer will indicate the remaining ACW time.
    • Manual Option: Agents can end ACW early if they complete their ACW before the timer ends.
    • Auto-Return to “Ready”: When the timer expires, the agent is automatically switched back to a “Ready” state.
    • Reporting & Analytics: ACW metrics will be captured for reporting.

Other Considerations
    1. Manual ACW Mode Only
        ◦ Pros: Offers flexibility for agents to manage their time.
        ◦ Cons: Leads to inconsistent usage and possible delays in handling subsequent calls.
    2. Fixed ACW with No Early Exit
        ◦ Pros: Ensures uniform ACW usage across agents.
        ◦ Cons: Agents may remain in ACW unnecessarily, reducing efficiency. Some services may requier more time than others.
Results
    • Improved Efficiency: Agents have structured post-call time, reducing workflow inconsistencies.
    • Better Adherence to Policies: Ensures that all agents follow a standardized process for post-call work.
    • Potential Agent Satisfaction Impact: Some agents may find the automatic ACW restrictive; hence, manual end transaction is provided as an option.
    • Increased System Complexity: Requires backend logic for managing ACW state transitions and UI updates.

Implementation 
    1. Update the Agent UI to include ACW state indicators and a countdown timer.
    2. Modify the backend to handle ACW state transitions based on call completion.
    3. Allow configuration of ACW durations at the system and queue levels.
    4. Implement manual exit functionality.
    5. Integrate ACW data into reporting dashboards.
    6. Conduct testing to validate timing accuracy and state transitions.
    7. Roll out in phases, starting with pilot groups before full deployment.
